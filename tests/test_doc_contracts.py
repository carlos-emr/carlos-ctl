"""Prose that must agree with the code, asserted rather than reviewed.

A documentation pass fixes what is wrong today; this file is what stops
it going wrong again. Each contract derives the truth from the code and
requires the operator-facing text to match, so adding an --accept class
or a run artifact without documenting it fails the build instead of
shipping.

Every contract here earned its place: each one had a live discrepancy
when it was written -- an accept class missing from two surfaces that
both claimed to enumerate them, and two run artifacts the man page's
FILES section did not mention.
