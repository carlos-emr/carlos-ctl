    """`destroy-data` is the documented decommissioning command and its
    own comment states its contract: "this command's whole value is that
    its report is exact -- 'destroyed' must not mean 'mostly'". It had no
    knowledge of the O19 import at all.

    It dropped the EMR schema and drugref2 and removed the documents,
    heap dumps and logs -- and left behind the `o19_archive` schema
    (which survives `--cleanup` BY DESIGN and holds the archive-class
    rows the clinic signed off with `--accept archived-forms`), the
    `o19_import` staging schema (the clinic's whole source database,
    whenever a run was abandoned before `--cleanup`), and the
    `/var/lib/carlos-emr/o19-import` workspace with
    `admin-credentials.txt` (a plaintext administrator password and PIN,
    deliberately excluded from `--cleanup`'s retirement list),
    `o19-derived-carlos.properties` (the clinic's carried secrets in
    clear), the archive CSV export and, for an abandoned run, `bundle/`
    with the source database as plaintext SQL. Then it printed "done."
    and returned 0. `carlos-emr.postrm` does not close the gap: it
    shreds two globs at -maxdepth 1 and never drops either schema.

    Standing rule: data is never destroyed silently, so each schema is
    announced with its table count before the DROP, and the estate is
    named again in the summary."""

    deletable.

    Branch coverage over the whole suite shows run_p0, run_p0_capacity,
    run_p1 and run_p2 executing only their `def` line. Their decision
    helpers are heavily tested as pure functions -- staging_drop_refusal
    has five tests, pristine_violations four, content_transfer_refusal
    seven -- but nothing asserted that the phases still CALL them. Nine
    gates were each replaced in turn by their permissive answer
    (`refusal = None`, `violations = []`, the `if` deleted) and the full
    suite stayed green every time.

    Reaching them behaviourally means standing up a server, a dump
    stream, a documents tar and a Flyway run; the four drivers are
    orchestration, and a test elaborate enough to reach line 60 of
    run_p1 would pin its own scaffolding more than the invariant. What
    is pinned instead is the one thing a deletion destroys: that the
    gate is still asked, inside the phase that owns it. The pure
    helpers' own tests say what each answer means.

    Adding a gate to a phase does not require touching this list.
    Removing one does -- which is the point."""
