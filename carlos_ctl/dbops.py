"""Database operations: the raw client, least-privilege accounts, Flyway.

Counterpart of carlos-podman carlos_ctl/dbops.py, with the same verb
contracts where the concept exists in both deployments:

  db          raw mariadb client passthrough as root (interactive shell with
              no args; args/redirects pass through) — identical semantics to
              the podman tool, minus the container hop.
  db-users    create-or-update the least-privilege accounts. Same name; here
              the set is carlos/drugref/backup (no exporter — there is no
              obs pod to feed).
  db-migrate  apply pending Flyway migrations.
  db-dump     consistent dump to stdout.

Administrative access is root@localhost over the unix socket: on Ubuntu that
account authenticates by uid, so root on the host is already root in the
database and NO password is stored anywhere for it — which is why this
package never asks for or records a MariaDB root password.

The account is also flagged for a FORCED PASSWORD RESET, which is how the
migrations seed it and which this package deliberately leaves in place: the
password above exists in a file on disk, so it must not stay in use. Your
first login goes straight to the reset page and asks for this password as the
"old" one, plus a new one of your choosing.

The PIN is four digits because the application accepts no other length.

DO THIS NOW, IN THIS ORDER:
  1. Log in and complete the forced password reset.
