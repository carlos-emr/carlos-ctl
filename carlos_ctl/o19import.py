"""carlos-ctl import-o19 / o19-preflight — OSCAR 19 clinic import
(experimental).

Phase pipeline (docs/oscar19-to-carlos-migration-plan.md §9a; each phase
records its completion + input digests in state.json under
/var/lib/carlos-emr/o19-import/). A rerun over existing state REQUIRES
--resume (or --cleanup); nothing is silently continued. Once the ETL has
started, the target is mid-import by design, so a resumed run re-checks
the schema/replica/disk gates but not the emptiness sweep P0 already
passed. Execution order on a real import is P0, P3, P1, P2, P4..P7: the
rollback snapshot exists before any clinic-supplied SQL executes. --dry-run
and the o19-preflight verb run P0 (capacity checks only for the latter),
P1 and P2 without recording a verdict; --dry-run additionally emits the
P6 properties report, marked as a dry-run fragment:

  P0 check-pristine  stock-initial-deploy gate (manifest-driven emptiness
                     sweep; hard refusal, no --accept; --dev-target
                     downgrades it to a warning for dev databases)
  P1 stage           restore the dump verbatim into the o19_import schema
                     (as a throwaway account whose grants stop at that
                     schema; a dump carrying USE/CREATE DATABASE is refused)
  P2 preflight       §6.1 go/no-go over the staged schema (o19_preflight,
                     import mode with column-level checks)
  P3 backup          restic snapshot via the systemd backup unit (rollback
                     point)
  P4 etl             manifest-driven copy into the carlos schema, then
                     the roles/privileges post-step (o19roles)     (M4, M8)
  P5 documents       OscarDocument restore + reconciliation           (M5)
  P6 props           oscar.properties translation                     (M6)
  P7 verify          row parity + spot checks + role checks       (M4+, M8)

Every migration's output should receive a technical review — verification
report, spot checks, UI smoke — before clinical use.

    upgrade gate clears as soon as `verify` is done, and NEXT_STEPS puts
