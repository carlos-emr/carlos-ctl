"""The deployment substrate the OSCAR 19 import runs on.

Everything in the importer that is not about OSCAR 19 or CARLOS — where
the workspace lives, how a mariadb client is spawned, who takes the
pre-import snapshot, how the application is asked whether it is running —
is answered by ONE object, so a second deployment can answer differently
without a second orchestrator.

Why an object rather than a second copy of `o19import`: the ledger, the
workspace lock, the resume rules, the phase order, the refusals and the
validation report are the parts a clinic's data depends on, and they are
identical on every deployment. A carlos-podman port that re-implemented
them would be a second implementation of the same safety properties,
drifting from this one commit by commit. What genuinely differs is small
and named here.

`Host` IS the deb package's implementation — the default, and the only
one in this repository. carlos-podman subclasses it and overrides the
handful of methods whose answers differ (the client runs `podman exec`
into the database container, the workspace lives under `$EMR_HOME`, the
snapshot comes from restic through `carlos-ctl backup`, the app-running
question is asked of the pod). Nothing here knows that.
