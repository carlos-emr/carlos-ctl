"""--bundle handling for the OSCAR 19 importer (experimental).

A bundle is ONE archive holding the migration inputs at its ROOT, paths
trimmed: the database dump (*.sql / *.sql.gz), optionally the
OscarDocument tar (*.tar / *.tar.gz), the clinic's *.properties file and,
optionally, the clinic-side content digests (*.json, written by
`o19_preflight.py --digests`) that P2 compares the restored staging
schema against.
Accepted bundle names: *.tar, *.tar.gz, *.tar.enc, *.tar.gz.enc — .enc means
openssl password-based symmetric encryption (canonical creation command in
docs/o19-import-deb.md; default derivation -pbkdf2 -iter 200000).

Design rules (migration plan §"--bundle"):
 - member identification is by extension and AMBIGUITY IS A HARD ERROR —
   never guess which of two .sql files is the dump;
 - tar members with path separators or '..' are refused (no traversal from
   a clinic-supplied archive);
 - a wrong password/derivation NEVER fails silently: openssl's exit code or
   a failed tar magic check aborts with the two usual causes and their
   --bundle-openssl-opt remedies spelled out.

Pure classification/command-construction functions live up top (unit
tested); the thin execution helpers at the bottom go through util.run.
