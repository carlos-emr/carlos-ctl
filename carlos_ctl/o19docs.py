"""Documents phase (P5) of the OSCAR 19 importer (experimental).

Restores the clinic's OscarDocument tree into the deb layout
(/var/lib/carlos-emr/CarlosDocument/carlos/…), renames the O19 context
directory, relocates HRM reports flat under document/ (refusing when two
HRMDocument rows would reach the same basename by different paths) and
rewrites their absolute paths, then runs the BLOCKING
reconciliation of docs plan §5: every `document.docfilename` and every
eForm `${oscar_image_path}` asset must resolve to a real file; orphan
files are report-only; derived cache directories (`document_cache`, …)
are skipped with a report line and never migrated. Finally the
`o19_archive` schema is exported as CSV into the root-only import state
directory (`.../o19-import/o19-archive-export/`), NOT into the documents
tree -- that tree is owned by the service account, and this export is the
clinic's readable copy of records that became archive-only.

    place is dropped from the source instead.

    `dst_fd` is an open descriptor for the directory CONTAINING `dst`,
    and every destination operation goes through it. `dst` itself is
    carried only to name the path in a refusal.

    Descending by descriptor is what makes the walk race-free. Checking
    each level with `lstat` and then acting by path leaves a window: the
    directory that passed the check a moment ago can be moved aside and a
    symlink put in its place, and the rename of a DESCENDANT then
    resolves through it -- the parent's own check never sees it, because
    the swap happens after. A descriptor names the inode, so once each
    level is opened `O_NOFOLLOW` no later rename of the names above it
    can redirect the move."""
