"""OSCAR 19 import — post-copy reconciliation of roles, privileges and the
rows CARLOS code requires (M8; plan §4.5 "Roles, privileges and
CARLOS-required rows").

Why this step exists. CARLOS's privilege check is exact-match and
deny-by-default: `hasPrivilege` reads `secUserRole` rows with
`activeyn = 1`, joins them to `secObjPrivilege` by role NAME, and knows no
parent fallback (`_admin.fax` does not inherit `_admin`). The table loop
copies the clinic's roles and assignments id-intact (`secRole`,
`secUserRole` are replace_seed) and MERGES the clinic's grants under
CARLOS's seeded matrix (CARLOS wins on a (role, object) collision, clinic
rows append). What the merge alone cannot give the clinic:

* the break-glass admin needs ACTIVE roles, a program membership and a
  facility link (case management and login fail closed without them);
* the webapp's first start creates program `OSCAR` with a membership for
  the seeded clinician — who no longer exists after the import (the
  `program_provider.provider_no` FK would then fail at startup);
* every active provider needs a `program_provider` row, or encounter
  notes and issues are unreadable (`CaseManagementManagerImpl` returns
  false with no membership);
* a clinic-custom role holds only what the clinic granted in O19; the
  CARLOS-era objects (`_fax`, `_email`, `_rx.editPharmacy`, ...) are
  backfilled from the stock role it resembles most;
* `secUserRole.activeyn` NULL grants nothing in CARLOS — rows of active
  accounts are activated (user decision) and every change is reported;
* data normalisation CARLOS ships only as post-baseline scripts
  (prevention type codes, the Rich Text Letter eForm) never reaches
  imported rows through Flyway, which ran on the empty deploy first.

Every write is idempotent (INSERT ... WHERE NOT EXISTS / INSERT IGNORE /
guarded UPDATE) and every sub-step is ledger-marked, so `--resume` re-runs
nothing that completed. Statement builders are pure (schema names in, SQL
out) for the unit tests; `run_roles` wires them to the ETL ledger.

Report hygiene: role and object names are not PHI and go to report.txt;
provider numbers and user names are PHI-correlating and go to the root-only
files written with `o19import.write_private`.

    Archived before deletion, not just deleted: the row is the clinic's
    own menu entry and the form's DATA is preserved as
    `import_archived_<form table>`, so the pointer to it is kept too and
    nothing about the removed form is orphaned.

    The WHOLE row is archived, not the pair the report happens to print.
    `encounterForm` is (form_name, form_value, form_table, hidden) with
    `form_value` -- the URL the menu entry points at -- as its PRIMARY
    KEY, so archiving only (form_table, form_name) would keep a record
    that the entry existed while losing what it did, and requirement B
    is that nothing the import removes is left unrecoverable. Keying the
    NOT EXISTS guard on `form_value` for the same reason: two entries
    can share a table and a name and differ only in the URL, and a guard
    on the pair would archive the first and silently drop the second.

    Both statements are idempotent -- the INSERT is guarded by NOT
    EXISTS on the archive and the DELETE's own predicate is false once
    the rows are gone.

    The guard is form_value equality and NOTHING ELSE, deliberately.
    Rows an older carlos-ctl archived hold NULL there, and matching them
    on their (form_table, form_name) pair instead -- which an earlier
    version of this function did -- suppresses EVERY live entry sharing
    that pair, not the one row the legacy row stood for. The DELETE that
    follows is not similarly narrowed, so those entries left with no
    archive row at all: requirement B inverted, and worse than the
    duplicate the pair-match was added to avoid.

    `encounter_form_backfill_statement` is what makes the narrow guard
    safe: it gives a legacy row its form_value back wherever that is
    UNAMBIGUOUS. Where it is not, the legacy row keeps its NULL, every
    live entry archives in full, and the archive carries one harmless
    duplicate. Duplicates are recoverable; a deleted row with no archive
    row is not, so the ambiguity resolves toward the archive every
