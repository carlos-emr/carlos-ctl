"""Finishing an installation whose database provisioning did not run.

carlos-emr.postinst provisions the database — settings drop-in, least-privilege
accounts, the Flyway schema, the seeded administrator credential, the optional
demonstration dataset — with provisioning errors deliberately non-fatal to dpkg.
Failure to contain a potentially live seeded credential is the safety exception.
A database that is unreachable, or a migration that fails, must not leave dpkg
with a half-configured package: that would block the other two CARLOS packages
and any unrelated package in the same apt transaction, and it would give the
operator no recovery instructions.

The cost of that choice is what an alpha tester hit on a fresh desktop install:
apt exits 0, the summary says nothing is wrong, and the host has no clinical
schema at all. The diagnosis was printed — on stderr, in the middle of a long
install, where a graphical or quiet front end never shows it — and nothing
retried it, so a reboot left the system exactly as broken. DrugRef "not
answering on loopback" is the same failure seen from the other end: it shares
the EMR's Tomcat, which is never started while the schema is missing.

This module closes that hole from both ends:

  * A durable marker (``/var/lib/carlos-emr/.install-incomplete``) records that
    provisioning is owed, and what the install asked for. The postinst writes
    it, ``carlos-ctl check`` reports it first, and the postinst raises a
    debconf note so the failure reaches an operator who never saw stderr.
  * ``carlos-ctl finish-install`` resumes provisioning from wherever it
    stopped, and carlos-emr-provision.service runs it once at boot, ordered
    before carlos-emr.service, so an install interrupted by a database that
    went away completes by itself.

Nothing here is a second implementation of provisioning: every step is the same
carlos-ctl verb the postinst calls, in the same order. Unlike dpkg configure, this repair command must return
nonzero when any requested step fails.
