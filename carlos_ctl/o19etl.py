"""ETL phase of the OSCAR 19 importer (experimental): manifest-driven copy
from the o19_import staging schema into the live CARLOS schema, plus the
o19_archive capture of everything CARLOS no longer models.

Statement GENERATION is pure (unit-tested against golden SQL); EXECUTION
goes through the caller-supplied query callable with a session prelude of
sql_log_bin=0, FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0, sql_mode='' (the bulk copy is
deliberately outside the binlog — the pre/post backups bracket it, and P0
refused replicas).

Sanitizer policy (migration plan §4.3): zero dates NULL out only where the
target column is nullable; enum values outside the target's set fall to the
column default WITH a report line; over-length values ERROR before any copy
— truncating PHI silently is never acceptable. CARLOS-added NOT NULL
columns without defaults abort with the list of columns needing a
value_exprs curation entry, before anything is written.

Surrogate ids: a merge-class table whose natural key is not its PK gets
fresh AUTO_INCREMENT ids for appended rows. Every such table therefore
records an old->new id map in o19_archive (<table>__idmap), and child
tables declared in the manifest's `fk_remap` read their foreign key
through that map — a clinic-defined lookup list keeps its items.

Everything the manifest does not know is still preserved: staging tables
absent from the manifest are archived whole (unknown-as-archive), and
columns the manifest does not map on known tables are shadow-captured.

    * without one, the manifest guarantees the natural key IS the
      primary key (the generator refuses any other shape), so the
      natural-key join pairs one row with one row.

    The surrogate itself is left out of the comparison: the merge

    A row count cannot see a column: a copy that named the prefixed

    passes `row_parity` unchanged. So each preserved column is counted
    where it is not NULL, on both sides, and the two must agree.

    * `property` -- the roles post-step prunes removed-module rows from
      the TARGET after the merge, taking their `import_archived_`

    * `merge_exclude` rows -- never inserted by `merge_statement` and
      deliberately skipped by `archived_backfill_statement`, so they
      have no target value to count.
