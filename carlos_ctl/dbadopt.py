"""Adopting a pre-Flyway (OSCAR 19 / OpenO) database into the Flyway history.

`db-baseline` is documented as the verb that adopts an existing pre-Flyway
schema, but for most of its life it was a bare passthrough to Flyway's
`baseline` command -- and Flyway `baseline` writes ONE ROW into
`flyway_schema_history`. It never executes `V1__baseline_schema.sql`.

That is fine for the half of the genesis the forward migrations re-assert
anyway, and wrong for the rest. Stamping at 1.0.2 is an ASSERTION that common
`V1` and the province `V1.0.1`/`V1.0.2` are already satisfied by the adopted
datadir. An authentic OSCAR 19 datadir forked from the CARLOS lineage years
before those files existed, so the assertion is false in a specific, silent
way: every column that has been part of the schema since `V1` -- rather than
being added by a later forward migration -- is simply missing.

Nothing catches it. `db-migrate` reports success, `db-validate` passes (it
compares the HISTORY against the WAR's migrations, not the live schema against
either), and the install fails at runtime the first time a clinician logs in:

    Unknown column 's1_0.mfaSecret'           -> login dies
    ProviderPreference.defaultBillingLocation -> 500 immediately after login

So this module makes the assertion TRUE before it is stamped. It reads the
genesis DDL out of the deployed WAR -- the same files Flyway would have run --
and reconciles the live schema up to it with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and
`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`. Both are no-ops on anything already
present, which is what makes the whole pass safe to run unconditionally and
more than once.

Two further things block a real clinic's forward migrations, and both are
handled here because they are properties of the ADOPTED DATA, not of the
migrations:

  * `V1.0.5` seeds `icd10` with two statements and only the first says
    `INSERT IGNORE`. The second collides with the legacy database's own ICD-10
    reference rows. `V1.0.5` is present unchanged in published release tags, so
    it cannot be edited (that would break the checksum for every existing
    install); the colliding rows are cleared here instead, after being copied
    aside, and the migration then lays down the canonical seed it intended to.

  * `V1.0.11`/`V1.0.12` add UNIQUE indexes on the OHIP/MCEDT billing
    filenames. Legacy submission filenames (`HA036013.001`) do not encode the
    year, so a clinic that bills every January for a decade has ten genuinely
    DISTINCT, real billing-submission rows sharing one filename string. None of
    it is duplicate data and none of it is safe to delete, so the rows are
    disambiguated -- and the value actually submitted to the Ministry is kept
    in a backup table, because that string is the clinic's record of what it
    sent.

Everything this module writes is either additive (a column, a table) or
recorded before it changes (a backup table), and `--dry-run` prints the whole
plan without touching the database.

    The premise of clearing these keys is that the migration lays down the SAME

    never by id, so a clinical record still naming it stops resolving.

    But the id carries no meaning of its own. Nothing in the schema references
    `icd10.id`: `dxresearch` stores the code string and has no foreign key
    here, and no query in the application selects by id. So a code that would
    otherwise be lost does not need deleting at all -- it needs MOVING. Each
    diverging row is therefore classified:

      * its code also appears on a row outside the collision range, or among
        the canonical replacements -> the code survives the migration anyway,
        so the row is replaced as before and nothing is lost;
      * its code appears nowhere else -> it is genuinely local to this clinic,
        and the row is RE-HOMED to a fresh id above everything, keeping the
        code resolvable while the migration lays its canonical row at the id.

    Returns `(diverging, {old_key: new_key})`.

      A history written by `baseline` carries a BASELINE row and takes the
