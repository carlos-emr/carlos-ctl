"""Props phase (P6) of the OSCAR 19 importer (experimental).

Translates the clinic's deployed oscar.properties into a REVIEWED fragment
for /etc/carlos-emr/carlos.properties. Never merged automatically — the
fragment sits in the import state dir until an operator reviews and applies
it (docs plan §8.1: this is deliberately the one non-automatic step).

Rules, in order:
 1. Baseline-diff: keys equal to the stock O19 default are ignored —
    CARLOS defaults win wherever the clinic never made a choice. Where
    CARLOS's default DIFFERS from the O19 one (manifest CARLOS_DEFAULTS)
    that silently changes behaviour at cutover, so the key still earns a
    `carlos-default` report row naming both values; nothing is carried.
 2. Disposition from the generated manifest (o19map_props): exact KEYS
    first, then the ordered PREFIX_RULES; anything unmatched is `unknown`
    (reported for human classification, never silently carried/dropped).
 3. carry / carry-secret go into the fragment verbatim (secrets masked in
    the human report only), except that a carry key marked
    `rewrite: bundle` has its `${...}` message-bundle tokens remapped onto
    the names CARLOS uses, and is refused when one cannot be mapped;
    translate rewrites OscarDocument context paths
    onto the CARLOS tree and resolves drugref to the deployment's own
    endpoint; deploy-owned is refused with a note; dropped-flag is
    itemized by module advisory (ldap escalated already at preflight).
