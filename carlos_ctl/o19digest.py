"""Content digests: prove the migration carried the VALUES, not just the
row counts.

`row_parity`, `preserved_parity` and `archived_column_parity` all count.
They prove no row was orphaned, which is a different claim from "every
row arrived intact": a copy that moves the right NUMBER of rows with the
wrong values passes all three. This module builds the digest that closes
that gap, and the comparison that reports it.

The primitive, and why each part of it is there -- every one of these was
measured against MariaDB 10.11 before being written down, because the
naive spelling of this check is worse than no check at all:

* `CONCAT_WS` SKIPS NULLs, so `('a', NULL, 'c')` and `('a', 'c', NULL)`
  hash IDENTICALLY. A column-swap bug would verify clean. Every column
  therefore carries an explicit NULL marker.
* A bare marker (`~`) is forged by a literal `~` in clinic data. Each
  value is length-prefixed, which makes the encoding prefix-free: no
  arrangement of values can imitate another.
* `BIT_XOR` alone cannot see a deleted IDENTICAL PAIR -- two equal rows
  cancel, so losing both leaves the digest unchanged. Hence the SUM lane.
* `SUM` alone promotes to DOUBLE past 2^53 and silently goes inexact.
  Hence the DECIMAL(30, 0) cast.
* The two lanes read DIFFERENT 16-hex-digit halves of the same SHA-256,
  so they cannot fail together on a collision in one half.
* `CONCAT`/`CONCAT_WS` do not raise when their result would exceed the
  server's `max_allowed_packet`: they return NULL with warning 1301.
  Measured: an 8.4 MB scanned document HEXes to 16.8 MB, and under the
  stock 16M setting `CONCAT(CHAR_LENGTH(HEX(doc)), ':', HEX(doc))` was
  NULL -- so the `IFNULL` filed the document as a NULL, two different
  documents hashed the same, and the digest of ONE table came out
  different under 16M and 1G. The clinic's server and the CARLOS host
  do not share that setting. So a value that can reach megabytes
  (`LARGE_TYPES`) is hashed ON ITS OWN first and only its 64-character
  SHA-256 is concatenated; the row is joined with NULL-propagating
  `CONCAT` rather than `CONCAT_WS`, so anything that still collapses
  makes the row hash NULL; and a fourth lane COUNTS the rows whose hash
  is NULL, so a row nobody hashed is reported, never silently skipped
  by SUM and BIT_XOR (both ignore NULL).
* `HEX()` is bounded by `max_allowed_packet` too -- on MariaDB 11.8, the
  server Ubuntu 26.04 ships, not on 10.11, where the format-2 rules were
  measured. Measured on 11.8.6: `HEX()` of an 8.4 MB document (16.8 MB
  of digits) under the stock 16M is NULL with warning 1301 "Result of
  hex() was larger than max_allowed_packet", and format 2's
  `IFNULL(..., '~')` then filed the document as a NULL VALUE -- the
  fourth lane stayed at zero and one table digested differently under
  16M and 1G, the exact defect format 2 was meant to close. Two changes
  follow. A large binary value is hashed as its RAW BYTES (`SHA2(col,
  256)` with `LENGTH(col)`): SHA2 over the column itself and CONVERT
  are not bounded (measured: a 20 MB LONGBLOB and a 20 MB LONGTEXT both
  hash under 16M on 11.8), so no intermediate rendering the server can
  refuse is built at all. And every contribution is guarded with `CASE
  WHEN col IS NULL` on the COLUMN rather than `IFNULL` on the rendered
  piece, so a NULL that a server produces by REFUSING a rendering is
  never mistaken for a stored NULL: it propagates through the CONCAT,
  makes the row hash NULL, and lands in the fourth lane, where
  `compare` reports the table as not verified.

Charset: the clinic's OSCAR 19 stores latin1 and live CARLOS is utf8mb4,
so the same logical text has different STORED BYTES (`Santé` is
`53 61 6E 74 E9` there and `53 61 6E 74 C3 A9` here). Every value is
normalised to utf8mb4 before hashing, or the P7 comparison would
disagree on every accented row of every clinic. At P2 the two sides
usually agree already -- mysqldump writes each table's RESOLVED charset
into its DDL (measured: a table created with no `DEFAULT CHARSET` in a
latin1 database still dumps as `DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1`), so the restored
staging tables are latin1 like the clinic's and the CONVERT is a no-op
there. It is kept anyway: it costs nothing, and it is what keeps the
transfer check from failing a correct restore taken under a client or
server whose character-set defaults differ.

Binary columns never go through a character set: converting a scanned
document "to utf8mb4" is not a round trip. A bounded binary (BINARY,
VARBINARY, BIT, TINYBLOB, the geometry types) is hexed, which is what
makes a BIT or a GEOMETRY unambiguous; a BLOB that can reach megabytes is
hashed as its raw bytes, because its hexed form is the one rendering a
server can refuse. A type in NEITHER list is refused rather than guessed
at: CONVERT is not injective over binary values (two different BIT
values both render as `?`) and HEX rounds a decimal to an integer, so the
wrong choice yields a digest that agrees while the data differs.
